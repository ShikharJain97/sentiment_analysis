[fullText]:The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

[fullText]:I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

[fullText]:Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

[fullText]:Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.

[createDate]:Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
[summary]:
[fullText]:I bought this for one reason, and one reason only: size. Many of the other mp3 players out there were larger and clunkier. I own a Handspring Visor Deluxe and was going to use that as an mp3 player because of the aforementioned clunky sizes of other players. &quot;Why spend money for something that's not much smaller?&quot; I thought. Then, I stumbled across this baby... I read the specs and was admittedly not too impressed. 32 megs is not much, especially if you're going for full stereophonic 128 kbps sound. At that rate you could only get about half an hour of music - enough to go to the store, but not much more. Of course, there was always the option of a memory card but those added to the cost. It looked like I was going to pass this player by until I saw one on sale at an un-named competitor of this fine site. At the price I saw it for, I had to take the chance... Twenty four hours later, I'm still in awe. To begin with, just seeing the darn thing gives you a swell feeling. It's tiny, I mean tiny. It made my wife proclaim it to be &quot;cute.&quot; In such a small package I was expecting so-so sound at best. Not true. It is super duper. The built-in equalizer is servicable enough, and it takes a quick press o' the button to change settings. So I was hooked on the sound and size, there was only the capacity issue to consider... Then I rememberd my good friend db PowerAmp Music Converter (search for it on the web). This sweet program lets you convert current mp3's to lame or blade mp3's with a smaller bit rate. Smaller bit rate means smaller size. Smaller size means less space on the 32 meg memory, which translates into more sound. Lovely. Some will decry encoding anything to less than cd (128 kbps) sound, but pah I say. I was born and raised on analog and a little less crispness in my music is actually preferred. The human ear can barely discern the difference between 80 and 128 kbps recordings anyway, so why bother? At 80 kbps I can squeeze about 50 minutes or so of music into that 32 megs. Not bad. Not bad at all. After I buy a 64 or 96 meg card, I'll be waltzing back and forth to work with only my tiny kazoo as my companion. Beautiful. If you are reading this and thinking either &quot;What in hades is he talking about?&quot; or &quot;That is way to much bother for listening to some music!&quot; please reconsider! It takes only a few minutes (even for you 56 k types) to download db PowerAmp and a few more to convert the mp3's to lower bitrates. Trouble? Nah. At least not for the payoff. Sweet music for a sweet price. Did I mention it's tiny and cute? Buy this mp3 player and be a happy camper. It's a wonder.

[fullText]:Beware when considering this product!  Although it prominently displays the USB compatability, it does not state on the exterior package that it is only Window compatible.  When I found a friend foolish enough to be using Window's software I got some music loaded into it.  It is a remarkable device, small, easy to use, good sound quality, and expandable.  However, after about 1 month of use the screen died and it is currently in route to RCA for a repair/replace.  I complained to them that the word Universal in USB should mean Universal, i.e. both Mac and Windows compatible.

[title]:The smallest MP3 player; very well designed.
[author]:
[createDate]:Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2001
[summary]:
[fullText]:After about a week of researching about 25 mp3 players I finally settled on the RCA Kazoo. I wanted the smallest mp3 player possible, but didnt want to sacrifice great sound. My Kazoo delivers for only $... After much research I decided I needed a unit that had: lock (so buttons dont get pushed accidentally), bass boost/ equalizer, digital volume control, big clear display, & fast transfer rate (2.4Mb/sec). You'd be supprised many more expensive units dont have all of these features. I also didnt care about other formats since mp3 is the standard & all formats can be converted to mp3 via software. The included software Music Match & Real Jukebox are excellent. I just dragged & dropped my mp3 files from explorer into real Jukebox. Real Jukebox lets you set the bit rate you would like and automatically lowers bitrate on files to bitrate you choose to save memory/size. This brigs me to the 1 of 2 drawbacks. ALthough 32 mb is common w/ mp3 players it isnt enough (at 128k bit rate). I plan on ordering a 64 MB MM card (dont pay more than $1/mb if you decide to buy memory). I did find out that at 56k the sound was still awesome & I can hold about 75 minutes of music w/o extra memory. The second drawback doesnt apply to me but I read in one review that this doesnt support Mac. If you are a windows user you will be very satisfied!! I can't see why anyone could buy a player w/ a slower transfer rate; USB is the way to go. <br>One last note: The display is large & easy to read. It shows track, time, bit rate, volume, battery, & dsp.  It does not show the name of the current song that is playing the way larger mp3 players do.<br>Hope this helps & good luck in your search.

I can fit up to 10 songs on it. If it had more memory I would give it a five star. But great for beginners who want a mp3 player because it's so inexpensive and it's easy to use.

[summary]:
[fullText]:I bought this player and was fairly happy with it.  It is very small and sounds fine.  Unfortuneately, I lost the cd containing the drivers for it.  I called customer service to get a replacement cd.  My first call to RCA/Thompson technical support directed me to a page where I could download software for the RCA Lyra.  After telling the representative that I had the K@zoo, and not the Lyra, he said &quot;sorry, that's all the information I have.&quot;  <p>Today, I figured I'd try again - maybe there'd be more information.  This time I was told, in fact, that the software is not available online, but that the cd could be shipped to me.  However, it would cost $12.95 for a cd containing one driver, and 2 free to download software programs.  I was about to order, when I was then informed of the $9.95 SHIPPING FEE.  TO MAIL ME ONE COMPACT DISK.  <p>Needless to say, I am far from pleased, and I urge anyone considering buying an RCA product to stay far, far away.  If you ever need customer service (and judging by the reviews of many mp3 players, you will), you will greatly regret the purchase.

[fullText]:I bought this today and I'm very pleased.  The size is great (very small), the sound quality is excellent, and the behind-the-ear headphones that it came packaged with are also very nice.  The price is very low and the USB feature makes transfer easy.  The software included is relatively simple to use and allows you to insert cds, and create MP3 files.  <br>The only drawback is that the 3 ways they made for you to wear it are pretty bad.  It comes with a pendant (who wants to have it swinging around their neck?) a little plastic pouch that is very hard to put on your belt, and a wrist strap.  I found a good way to wear it, though.  Buy one of those little sticky things with the belt clip that you use for a cell phone and then just clip it on your belt with that.  Once you get that, it's perfect.

Windows Media Player doesn't see it either.  <p>The USB cable is too short if you have a tower machine.  It doesn't even reach to the counter.

[fullText]:While this unit best feature is it's small light weight size, without a memory card you can only get 6-8 MP3's on the built in 32 meg of flash ram. Also I've heard that the software won't work with Windows XP, I had planed on upgrading soon? The headphones are pretty good although they start to hurt the ears after 30-40 mins. This MP3 player sure blows away those old clunky walkman CD players, it's 1/10th of the size and weight! Smaller is indeed better!

[productName]:Oregon Scientific MP210/BL512C 512 MB Micro Thin Card-Sized MP3 Player with FM & Voice Recorder
[title]:Elegant Package,  Easy To Operate, Surprising FM Tuner
[author]:David Gurgel
[createDate]:Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
[summary]:
[fullText]:This MP3 player, voice recorder, FM radio all-in-one is 1/4" longer and same width as my AMEX card and 1/4" thick. Five buttons on two edges control all functions while 1" X 5/8" see-through display gives needed info. Diplay was B in normal room light with my trifocal glasses and was C- with adjustable edge lighting in dark rooms. The built-in battery recharges from any USB connection. You will want a short USB connector, not the six-footer that is included - compactness is why you buy it.<br /><br />Windows 2000 and XP recognize the player at once when connecting with the USB cable. The player comes up as an external drive, so just move files with Explorer and you are set.<br /><br />Voce recorder is easy enough and did an adequate job recording me from my shirt pocket with decent fidelity. Probably OK on a desktop to pick up two or three people around the desk. Built-in mic is the only choice.<br /><br />FM tuner sensitivity was a nice surprise. Reception in my office was as clear and sensitive as on my Grundhig portable, and it automatically scanned in 30 stations on first use. (Presets can of course be manually chosen.) The earbuds are the antenna.<br /><br />A crummy cloth bag was included, but a small leather slip case with a pocket clip would have been so easy to do and much more useful.<br /><br />Sound with the included earbuds seemed fine to me - definitely a a few steps above entry level.The unit is nicely packaged and looks like it could be dropped a good number of times with no problems.

[fullText]:I had great hopes for this product, and I read the reviews so I only have myself to blame, but this is not a very well built product. Catchy see through display is hard to read. On/Off is tough and not very intuitive. Sound was good. Radio was limited in its ability to "tune". If I had the chance, I wouldn't buy it again. Sorry!

[summary]:
[fullText]:Ok, first of all, in response to a few of you who have 'reviewed' the Zen Micro already:  If there aren't many OGG players out there, there's probably a good reason for it. For some reason, 'Betamax' keeps ringing in my ears...  Second, no one, and I mean NO ONE, listens to AM radio. Unless you want to catch 'the game', or perhaps you're just grumpy because your cane has fallen behind the washing machine again and you can't reach it?  Third, if your girlfriend laughs at you, tell her where to shove it. Strap on a pair man. If anything you should feel smug for owning a quality piece of intriguing equipment.  As an iPod owner, I can say well done to creative for emulating apple's simplicity and sleek looks. I'd be interested.

[title]:Get a Rio Karma instead
[author]:Marc A. Stock "lathion"
[createDate]:Sun Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
[summary]:
[fullText]:This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.  The karma also has a very long battery life.  Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  No comparison in my opinion.

[summary]:
[fullText]:This is not really a review since the product isn't even available yet.  I'd just like to point out to the all the ipod lovers out there that this device completely rules the ipod when it comes to the battery.  If the ipod's battery stops taking a charge, which usually happens after about 18 months of steady use, you CAN'T replace it yourself.  You have to send it back to the factory where they charge you ninety-nine bucks plus shipping.  For that simple reason I will never own an ipod.

[title]:The Preview
[author]:Roman Kudryashov
[createDate]:Tue Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
[summary]:
[fullText]:Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod. Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well. As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. $190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players). As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short one again.  Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors. It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to the Pencil? Stopping going in circles and get to the point. Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )

[title]:Should be good
[author]:N. Seybert
[createDate]:Tue Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
[summary]:
[fullText]:Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"  Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.

That's huge! - Also much better battery life than the iPod Mini.  On par with the Carbon - Voice/Radio recording a +, but not a big one for me

[title]:The first legitimate iPod mini killer
[author]:Alex

[summary]:
[fullText]:Creatives new Zen micro is a promising mp3 player for people of all ages. It seems to be the only mini-drive player that can compete with the iPod mini. Compared to the mini, heres are the pros and cons:   Pros-Removable battery, Better battery life, Ten electrifying colors(5 more than the mini), Intuitive vertical Touch Pad, Mesmerizing blue glow, FM radio with recording, Voice recording and built in mic, Twice the internet music access(including Napster, MSN's music service and more), Comes with everything you need (A belt clip that doubles as a stand, a protective carrying case, a USB 2.0 cable, a universal AC adapter and in-ear dynamic bass response earbuds)  Cons-Even though it hold more songs than the iPod mini,5gb may not be enough storage for a growing music library, Does not have games which should not be an issue for most people, Not as many accessory options from brands other than Creative (but hey, it comes with everything you'll ever need, except the optional wired remote which i will be getting once i get mine)  All in all, this is a solid player for many users from the begginer to the audiophile  yes..i will be getting one, the Pros substantially outnumber the cons. This is the player ive been looking for.

[title]:I'm an IPod mini owner but...
[author]:Timothy Stoehr
[createDate]:Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
[summary]:
[fullText]:this item does intrigue me. And by the way don't label the IPod owners as brainwashed when you're raving about a product you haven't even seen yet. And if you believe the battery will last 12 hours just cuz Creative says it will, they YOU'RE brainwashed. Also, Creative is NOT the first to market this kind of MP3 player. They followed after the PJB-100 from Hy-Tek or Hango or someone like that. I had one of those (paid thru my nose) and later I had the Creative Jukebox. The Jukebox I owned was a piece of garbage. The user interface was either insanely poor, or it was malfunctioning upon arrival. It stopped working completely after a few months. So I'm a bit leary about the zen micro.  However, comparing it to my IPod mini, I seem some positives: 1.) Modular battery. 2.) FM radio. 3.) Possibly better buttons. (never liked the IPod wheel)  I wonder if the buttons operate as well as the IPod's wheel, which can be a nuisance sometimes. Cuz when your trying to use it for a button sometimes it thinks your trying to use it as a wheel. And I don't think anybody has ever improved on the good old standard volume dial. But for surfing thru lists, or very long recordings, the IPod wheel rules.  One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable.  I am interested in the zen. But I'd really have to check it out in person first before being convinced one way or the other.  Can anyone who OWNS an IPod and a Zen comment on the relative sound quality? That's a big issue for me and if it does sound better, I might consider trying out the zen and possibly EBaying my IPod mini.

[fullText]:after about a month it started freezing regularly when I tried to turn it off. The only way to unfreeze the thing was to take the battery out. Then, about a week later, it just completely froze, and the screen showed a picture of an unhappy zen micro...   Well, obviously this wasn't normal, so I called Creative and they said normally they would replace it, but they discontinued the product. Oh well, I did get my money back, and the customer service was good, so 4 stars. I really liked it, and I would recommend it, I just hope it doesn't break.

[fullText]:I'm a fanatic...I normallly do alot of research before buying anything...I looked at the Creative Zen, mini-IPOD etc. Then I came across this beauty by chance on Amazon, released at the start of April. It is incredible..very light and tiny, beautiful clear screen, user-friendly software, great sound. The earphones included are terrible but thats pretty normal for this sort of purchase. Everyday use is childs-play, uploading songs is quick and easy. Controls are perfect too and well-designed.  I took a chance and bought this without any real knowledge of its reliability..so far so good..dropped it already and no problems. Also comes with a handy case.   Most of my friends have mini IPODs...I was tempted to join the masses...but everyone agrees this jukebox is superior...and its far nicer to look at..the aluminium finish is superb, though it does get smudged easily. I am a very proud owner so far. Added addition is ability to look at photos.  Be brave and buy this...you will not be disappointed!!!

[summary]:
[fullText]:The Good Stuff - Small dimensions, average build-quality - Shiney, polished-metal style materials (plastic, actually)  - 5Gb MicroDrive  - 5-way joystick plus a mechanical wheel-scroller for zooming quickly through lists  - Charges over USB  - Color screen (not TFT, the duller type) - File/Folder browsing AND iD3 based browsing (Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Year, etc)  - Profiling (can scan tracks and self-databased iD3-tag info like Rio Carbon, no software required)  - View photos  - 5-band custom EQ  - Choose MSC or MTP complient in the Settings Menu. First time we've seen this ability. Might as well stick with the Mass Storage Complient option unless you're a big fan of WMP10  - Damn near gapless MP3 playback  - Power output (volume) is very strong, like 50 steppings - Includes a protective case with belt clip and AC adapter (you don't get these with an iPod anymore) - Includes Sennheiser MX400 earbuds which are a lot better than you usually get for freebies  The Bad - No dedicated play controls, use the joystick instead  - Color screen is small (1-inch), colors are washy  - No FM radio or recording  - Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time - Battery life doesn't seem that great so far, like old iPod Minis - case does not have cut-outs for controls or screen  (...)

[title]:Disappointed

[summary]:
[fullText]:I recently purchased this product and expected a lot from it. The overall design is sleek and the advertised features impressed me. While the price tag is a bit steep, I nevertheless forked out the cash. To my surprised I was very disappointed by its performance. The USB cable was flimsy and didn't seem to fit my player properly, my computer would not recognize the device. I was forced to use an extra USB cable I had. While the music transfer was a breeze, my player began to get extremely hot in minutes. And froze on several occasions. While this might merely be one time malfunction, nonetheless for the 250 dollars I paid I expected a lot more. I would not recommend this product.

[title]:How RCA Lyra works with Napster To Go
[author]:Kris Kros "Kris"

[summary]:
[fullText]:How to make RCA Lyra RD2765 be recognized as MTP player and installed as Napster To Go device.  There are 2 settings you should check:  1) Be sure that your Protocol is set to MTP (Microsoft Transport Protocol) to insure that your device will work with N2G.   2) The correct MTP driver must be installed by Windows XP. If not, it will only be recognized as a USB Mass Storage device.  There are 2 protocols in this device: MTP & MSC.  You can switch between MTP & MSC if you are a Windows XP user. Unfortunately, old Windows O/S users like Win98 cannot make this switch. It will be fixed to MSC.  How to switch from MTP to MSC and vice versa.  1. From the settings menu, rotate the Control ring to select Advanced.  2. Push the Control Joystick to the right to view Advanced options.  3. The current protocol will be displayed.  4. Press the Control Joystick to switch be tween MTP and MSC.  5. Push the Control Joystick to the left to return to the previous submenu, or press the M button to exit the menu.    More information on MTP & MSC:  Why do I want to use MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) Mode?  MTP Mode is essential if you want to transfer DRM content to your Lyra Jukebox. Today MTP Mode is only supported in Windows XP and through Windows Media Player 10.0 or other special software provided by your music service provider. In MTP mode you Lyra Jukebox will no longer show up as a drive letter. So programs that were designed to work with a device that shows up as a drive letter will not be able to work directly with the Lyra Jukebox.  Why do I want to use MSC (Mass Storage Class) Mode?  If you are using Windows 98SE, ME or 2000 you can not use MTP Mode only MSC Mode is available. Your Lyra Jukebox will always show up as a MSC device.  If you are using Windows XP your Lyra Jukebox will show up as a MTP device, but we have provide you the option to be able to switch it to MSC Mode with a setting in the Advanced Options section of the Lyra Jukebox. Once this setting is set to MSC Mode every time you connect the device to the PC it will show up as a drive letter and allow you to use any software that can work with MSC Mode. This will also allow the current version of LyraDJ or any other playlist editing program to find the device.  All supported content put on the device in either mode MTP or MSC will be available to play on the device once it is disconnected from the PC. So you could add mp3 files in the  MSC Mode then run LyraDJ, Profile the device and disconnect it. Then switch it to MTP Mode and reconnect it and add DRM content to it.
